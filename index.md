### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
    
    Lab 5, part 1 rectarea.cc was a favorite because I was able to learn about using certain logical operators in certain functions. Also, using the logical operators in if and for loops allowed my knowledge to expand. The new declarations and inputs caught my attention due to their difficulty.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 sandwich.cc was a favorite because of the new use of the insertion operators. Using them before and after the parameters was different and interesting instead of just using them for a normal output. Also declaring values in a string was interesting instead of declaring in a typical int main function.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 pattern.cc was a favorite beause of the multiple different things to use in the for loop, like initialization, condition, and the iteration expression. It took me a while to fully understand when and why to use it, but I ended up getting the general gist of it. It still is difficult to know which condition or iteration expression to use in certain situations, but it's still interesting.
